  <div class="container"><h1 id="what-are-defects"><a class="header-link" href="#what-are-defects"></a>What Are Defects</h1>
<p>Defects are small impurities in otherwise perfect crystals. When describing crystalline solids we usually say that they exhibit a periodic crystal structure (a Bravais lattice), i.e. the cells (atoms or molecules) are arranged in a repeating pattern, which is symmetrical to discrete translations (determined by the unit cell&#39;s size). However, in nature we often see that the arrangement isn&#39;t perfect, and that some cells are misplaced (or missing) - this can happen at a single point in the lattice, or in large areas such as lines and even planes.</p>
<h2 id="different-types-of-defects"><a class="header-link" href="#different-types-of-defects"></a>Different Types of Defects</h2>
<p>Defects can be grouped into two basic groups, according to their geometry:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Single point defects: these include vacancy defects and interstitial defects.<ul class="list">
<li>Vacancy defects are lattice sites which would be occupied in a perfect crystals but are vacant. This can be found occurring naturally, but can also be created in lab using irradiation, for example.</li>
<li>Interstitial defects are lattice sites which should be empty, but are occupied by an atom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Line and plane defects: these include dislocations, grain boundaries and other bulk defects.<ul class="list">
<li>Dislocations happen when a line of atoms (rather than a single one) is misaligned. Dislocations are commonly divided into edge dislocations - dislocations that appear when a plane is terminated abruptly in the middle of the crystal - and screw dislocations - which are hard to visualize, but can be described as structure with a helical path traced around the dislocation line.</li>
<li>Grain boundaries are areas in the crystal where its crystallographic direction suddenly changes. They are described more in depth on the <a href="grain.html">Grain Boundaries page</a>.</li>
<li>Bulk defects are normally described as macroscopic defects (such as cracks) or a cluster of other defects (e.g. a void which is a cluster of vacancies).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, many other defects exist, some of which are merely combinations of defects mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-working-with-defects"><a class="header-link" href="#pros-and-cons-of-working-with-defects"></a>Pros and Cons of Working with Defects</h2>
<p>The problems and disadvantages of working with defects are pretty clear: They&#39;re hard to describe accurately - since defects break the perfect periodic nature of the crystal, they also break its periodic potentials. This means adjustments must be made around the defect site when it&#39;s a single point, and when it&#39;s a plane or line defect, whole planes of atoms must be taken into consideration and re-evaluted. This is very difficult to do by hand (even approximately), but also expensive when done by a computer. The additional time needed to write the program, as well as to run it can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>However, as explained above, defects are commonplace when studying real-world crystals, and for that alone it is important to consider and explore them. But are there also advantages to defects? Can they be used for a practical reason?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes, but in a very limited way. The most popular usage for defects in using an <abbr title="Nitrogen-vacancy center">NV</abbr> defect for quantum computing. Its robustness makes it a perfect candidate - its quantum state is easy to initialize, manipulate and measure<a href="#footnote-1" id="back-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
